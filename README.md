# TodoAppAppliation
This is  an example of a Full Stack Application using java with Spring Boot 2 for the back-end, and angular 10  

This application had two components the Back-End and the Front-End.    

## Prerequisites and Technologies 
For the development environment I use:
* Intellij Idea, Windows 10 Home
* [Spring Initialzr](https://start.spring.io/) 
* H2 as databases
* Java 8, Spring Boot 2, Maven, Spring Core, Spring Data, Spring Security, Hibernate and JPA
* [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)
* Angular 10 with TypeScript

### Architecture
![Alt text](img/High%20Level%20Architecture.png?raw=true "Solution")

A basic overview of the architecture
Basically are two components the front-end and the back-end, the back end are RestfullServices that are comsumed in the front-end.  
The application consists in a basic todo app with CRUD functionality, using angular, spring boot 2, using spring security with jwt for the autentication and using Hibernate with JPA in a H2 database.

#### Components
For the Back-End check the folder **todos-res-api** and for the Front-End check **frontend**, for more details.
