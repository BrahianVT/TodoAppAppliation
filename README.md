A basic overview of the architecture
Basically are two components the front-end and the back-end, the back end are RestfullServices that are comsumed in the front-end.  
The application consists in a basic todo app with CRUD functionality, using angular, spring boot 2, using spring security with jwt for the autentication and using Hibernate with JPA in a H2 database.
